{"answer":"The documents appear to be notes from an experiment on a single-phase R-L-C circuit. The experiment involves measuring various voltages and currents across the circuit components, calculating impedance, and drawing phasor diagrams to analyze the circuit's behavior. The notes cover topics such as steady-state response, power factor, impedance, and the differences between ideal and practical inductors and capacitors. The experiment aims to understand the behavior of R-L-C circuits under different conditions, including inductive and capacitive circuits, and resonance.","chunks":[{"id":"b65c65b8-bb52-43b9-845e-0a292cd49254","text":"Ω Sl no Position of Rheostat VS Volts I Amp VR Volts VL Volts VC Volts VRL Volts 1 Middle position 100 V 2 Maximum position 100 V Updated on 7/10/2025 By AP/LD single phase variac -- 2 of 4 -- 51 Calculations -RLC Series circuit: Sl no.
