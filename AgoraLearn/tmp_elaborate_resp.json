{"answer":"Based on the provided context, it seems the question is asking for elaboration on the given information. \n\nTo elaborate, the operator a_1^† is defined as an integral over momentum space, involving a wave packet f_1(k) that is centered around k_1 and has a width of σ in momentum space. This operator is used to create a particle localized in momentum space near k_1 and in position space near the origin in the free theory. The wave packet f_1(k) is given by equation (5.7), which is a Gaussian function that decays rapidly as the momentum k deviates from k_1.","chunks":[{"id":"9a757238-cdc7-4d5e-bbbd-8b8660f8ec40","text":"Next, let us define a time-independent operator that (in the free theory) creates a particle localized in momentum space near k_1, and localized in position space near the origin:\n\na_1^† ≡ ∫d^3k f_1(k) a^†(k), (5.6)\n\nwhere\n\nf_1(k) ∝ exp[-(k - k_1)^2 / 4σ^2] (5.7)\n\nis an appropriate wave packet, and σ is its width in momentum space.\nhttps://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~mark/ms-qft-DRAFT.pdf","doc_id":"wavefn-1"}]}
