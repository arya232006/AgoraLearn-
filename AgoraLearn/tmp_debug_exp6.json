Object: To determine the steady state response and to calculate the impedance and power factor of R-L-C circuit. Theory: When an A.C. voltage (RMS) is applied to RLC series circuit as shown in circuit diagram of series circuit, it establishes RMS current I given by equation, 𝐼 = 𝑉 𝑍 , Where 𝑍 = √𝑅2 + (𝑋𝐿 − 𝑋𝐶)2, Z-is the overall impedance of series combination. In the circuit diagram the RMS value of supply voltage is equal to the vector addition of the voltage across inductor (VL), voltage across resistance (VR) & voltage across capacitor (Vc ). The phasor diagram for the circuit can be drawn which shows the magnitude as well as the phase relationship between the various voltages (VR, VL, Vc, Vs) & the total current I. The phasor diagrams will be of different nature for the cases 𝑋𝐿 > 𝑋𝐶 (Inductive circuit) & 𝑋𝐿 < 𝑋𝐶 (Capacitive circuit) 𝑋𝐿 = 𝑋𝐶 is said"},{"id":"7f1b7151-0e2e-454e-96af-671cb8edc0a6","doc_id":"exp6-1","text":"us voltages (VR, VL, Vc, Vs) & the total current I. The phasor diagrams will be of different nature for the cases 𝑋𝐿 > 𝑋𝐶 (Inductive circuit) & 𝑋𝐿 < 𝑋𝐶 (Capacitive circuit) 𝑋𝐿 = 𝑋𝐶 is said to be condition of resonance & the circuit will be resistive only. For the case, 𝑋𝐿 > 𝑋𝐶 , when power factor of the circuit is lagging in nature, since the current I lags behind V by an angle φ where 𝜑 = tan−1 (𝑋𝐿 −𝑋𝐶 𝑍 ) In an inductor, the copper losses take place due to the internal resistance of its coil. In capacitor, the losses take place in the dielectric medium used for making it but usually it is ignored.
