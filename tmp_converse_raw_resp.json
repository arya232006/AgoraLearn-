{"answer":"Kirchhoff's laws are two fundamental principles for analyzing electrical circuits. They consist of Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL), which states that the total current entering a junction equals the total current leaving it, and Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL), which states that the sum of the voltage drops around any closed loop in a circuit is zero. These laws are based on the conservation of charge and energy.","chunks":[{"id":"54301a87-0eb0-4e54-8236-82e3effae67d","text":"Kirchhoff's laws are two fundamental principles for analyzing electrical circuits: Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL), which states that the total current entering a junction equals the total current leaving it, and Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL), which states that the sum of the voltage drops around any closed loop in a circuit is zero.
